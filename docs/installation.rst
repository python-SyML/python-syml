Installation
============

To install SyML, you **must** clone the SyML github repository. To do so, you can run the following command :

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/python-SyML/python-syml.git

After cloning the repository, we recommend that you use a virtual environment. Once activated, you will need to run the following command in a terminal window
within the repository "python-syml" :

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install -e .
